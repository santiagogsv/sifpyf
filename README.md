## 📊 Why Economics?
My background in economics has trained me to look at problems through an analytical lens. From consumer behavior to market trends, I can translate data into actionable insights, a skill that's incredibly useful in software development as well.

I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends in technology and economics. Understanding the bigger picture helps me see how I can make a meaningful impact.
